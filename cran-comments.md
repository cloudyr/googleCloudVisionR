## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* fixed CRAN URLs to have the canonical format
* fixed the LICENSE format to the CRAN template for the MIT license
* removed the VignetteBuilder field from DESCRIPTION as we do not yet have vignettes

* In addition to these, I have added a new author to the DESCRIPTION file.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.5.1
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
Duration: 16.1s
